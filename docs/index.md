# Introduction

## Welcome!
This documentation aims to be an extensive hub of knowledge for the ManiaLink structure of Nadeo's videogame **Trackmania United Forever** and **Trackmania Nations Forever**. With the everchanging internet, it becomes harder and harder to find knowledge about ManiaLinks, while Trackmania 2 and Trackmania (2020) have an officially hosted API documentation by Nadeo, knowledge of the "Forever games" have been lost to time in old forums and websites long gone.

All data on this documentation has been retrieved using **archive.org** and manually checked and rewritten. Please see [Credits](credits.md) for an extensible list of ressources used to create this documentation.

## What is a ManiaLink?
A ManiaLink is a feature present in Nadeo's videogame **Trackmania United Forever** and **Trackmania Nations Forever**. The game features an in-game browser, similar to a webbrowser. With it, players can visit specially crafted "websites", called ManiaLinks. A ManiaLink can not only display text and images but also play sounds, music and enable players to download custom tracks, skins and replays.

## What is a ManiaCode?
A ManiaCode enables players to access tracks, skins and replays. Developers can optionally request **Coppers**, the games in-game earned currency to access these ressources.
