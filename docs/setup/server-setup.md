# Server Setup
If you want to serve your ManiaLink on the internet for other to see, you will need a webserver that can serve static files or a webserver that can serve dynamic ressources (if you are working on a dynamic ManiaLink).

Your server must serve ressources directly, security services like Cloudflare may interfere with access to your ManiaLink. Also note that HTTPS may not be working correctly with Trackmania Forever as the game still uses TLS 1.0 for secure connections.

!!! note
    If you are only serving a static ManiaLink, you can also use GitHub pages.
